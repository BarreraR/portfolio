                    <h2>About Raul</h2>
                    <p>
                        After graduating from UW Parkside with a degree in Computer Science, I opened a trucking company as 
                        the sole owner. This was a new and challenging experience, however, it did not feel like the right 
                        fit for me. Afterall, the reason I had even chosen computer science as my major was the result of the 
                        joy I felt creating my first programs in Qbasic back in high school. The feeling of accomplishment I got 
                        after finally getting the computer to do what I wanted was great!
                    </p>
                        If you are looking for a new addition to your developer team, please keep me in mind. Although my research 
                        internship was a collaboration between 3 people, I also have experience in an agile development setting 
                        using SCRUM from a university final project. I recall how exciting the group projects were and can not wait 
                        to repeat the experience of building great software together!
